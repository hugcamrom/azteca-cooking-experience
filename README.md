Welcome to the **Azteca Cooking Experience** – a digital cultural project celebrating authentic Mexican cuisine, created from over two decades of real-world culinary passion and teaching. This project is a continuation of the AZTECA brand, reborn online to share cooking classes, recipes, and stories that honour Mexican heritage.

## 🌟 About the Project

After 22 years running my restaurant and cooking school in Dublin, Ireland, I transitioned to an online space to continue sharing the joy of traditional Mexican cooking. My logo is proudly inspired by the **Aztec calendar**, symbolising deep cultural roots and the timeless joy of food.

Whether you want to cook along with me, learn about Mexican ingredients, or simply explore the flavours of Mexico, this space is for you.
