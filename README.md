## 🌟 About the Project

Welcome to the **Azteca Cooking Experience** – a cultural, culinary, and digital storytelling project.  
After 22 years running **AZTECA** (restaurant + school) in Dublin, Ireland, this platform continues my mission:  
to teach, celebrate, and share **authentic Mexican cuisine** online.

My logo is proudly inspired by the **Aztec calendar**, symbolising deep cultural roots and the timeless joy of food.
